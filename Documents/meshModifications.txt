meshModifications

To make collisions between meshes more accurate, you must build the simple collision for each mesh

1 - Open the mesh
2 - Remove the collision (Collision -> Remove)
3 - Open Auto Convex Collision
4 - Tweak settings
  Hull Count - 1
  Max Hull Verts - Default (Could Change)
  Hull Precision - 600000 (Could Change, but this is pretty accurate)
